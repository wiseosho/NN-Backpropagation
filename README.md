# Backpropagation of feedforward network 

This is the python practice code of Backpropagation of Feedforward Neural Network.
Basic code is based on the [sample code](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) for ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"]((http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), written by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/).

MNIST Handwriten digits are used as a practice data.
This code is tested on Anaconda 4.3(64bit, Python 3.6, Ipython 5.1)

Thank you Michael Nielsen for nice teaching materials and codes with good starting point.
